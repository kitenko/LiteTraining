Module: losses/utils.py

This module provides utility functions for handling weights used in loss computations.
The primary functionality includes loading class weights from JSON or YAML files.

Functions:
    - load_weights_from_file: Load class weights from a specified file (JSON or YAML).

Usage:
    The module assumes that a logger is configured elsewhere in the application.
    Use `load_weights_from_file` to load class weights into your training pipeline.
